Given 2 lists a and b. Each element is a pair of integers where the first integer represents the unique id and the
second integer represents a value. Your task is to find an element from a and an element form b such that the sum
of their values is less or equal to target and as close to target as possible. Return a list of ids of selected
elements. If no pair is possible, return an empty list.

# Example 1:
# Input:
a = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]]
b = [[1, 2]]
target = 7
# Output: [[2, 1]]
# Explanation:
# There are only three combinations [1, 1], [2, 1], and [3, 1], which have a total sum of 4, 6 and 8, respectively.
# Since 6 is the largest sum that does not exceed 7, [2, 1] is the optimal pair.

# Example 2:
# Input:
# a = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7], [4, 10]]
# b = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
# target = 10
# Output: [[2, 4], [3, 2]]
# Explanation:
# There are two pairs possible. Element with id = 2 from the list `a` has a value 5, and element with id = 4 from the list `b` also has a value 5.
# Combined, they add up to 10. Similarily, element with id = 3 from `a` has a value 7, and element with id = 2 from `b` has a value 3.
# These also add up to 10. Therefore, the optimal pairs are [2, 4] and [3, 2].

# Example 3:
# Input:
# a = [[1, 8], [2, 7], [3, 14]]
# b = [[1, 5], [2, 10], [3, 14]]
# target = 20
# Output: [[3, 1]]

# Example 4:
# Input:
# a = [[1, 8], [2, 15], [3, 9]]
# b = [[1, 8], [2, 11], [3, 12]]
# target = 20
# Output: [[1, 3], [3, 2]]
